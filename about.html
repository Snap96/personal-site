        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>My Story</i></p>
        <p class="w3-justify">
            Well, This is me... I've been coding since the age of about sixteen and honestly this has truly been a journey and still continues as I keep adding more chapters.
            I first started coding in high school after I chose to study IT as one of my subjects, I found the subject very interesting
            and managed to pass it in matric. Then Unable to get into a university I chose to enroll into a private college and ended up
            obtaining a higher certificate in Information Techonology followed by a bachelor's of science in Information Technology majoring
            in Software Engineering.  
        </p>
        
        <p class="w3-justify">
            I recently just Graduated from Pearson now known as Eduvous, and with the knowledge I've obtained i honestly feel ready for the next step.
            Becoming a Full stack developer and designing applications and systems to help aid business solutions. During my studies I was aided by a fellow
            Developer, named Ike Baloyi and honestly help find my path as developer and created a blueprint of technologies i could study during 
            share while I studying towards finishing my degree. 
        </p>

        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>What does Programming mean to me?</i></p>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Programming to me is basically an opportunity to create simple as that despite what people it being a boring job and sitting at computer
            all day for me, its a chance for me to express myself. Or even express someone else's thought which isnt always easy the challenge is seeing 
            something you've conceptualized in your mind and making it a reality and helping people where you can. 

            Consider the web applications created to track covid activity in other countries and the use of banking online from the comfort of your home, all posible 
            because code was used to execute people's thoughts. My hope is to become one of those indivduals who take ideas and express my thoughts on how 
            accomplish a task and obviously make some while doing it. 
        </p>

        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Interests out of being a developer?</i></p>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Soccer,
            Weight training,
            Listening to Podcasts,
            Spending time with friends and family 
        </p>

        <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Professional Interests?</i></p>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Currently, I have become interested in data engineering and data science mostly due to the Youtube recommendations but honestly it was become interesting for me.
            The concepts are very interesting but required a lot of attention to detail and research. Another important piece of knowlegde when covering those field is having a 
            good understanding of data structures and algorithms.
