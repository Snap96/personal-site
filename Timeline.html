                <p>During this time it was my second year of the degree and started learning about data structures and algorithms.

                <p>This was my first year of varsity and I had decided to take an extended program in order to enroll into my degree. During this year I was taught about the various fields avaliable in IT and covered some of the information gaps that were missing from my high school syllabus. I also learn't to code in Java and C++ started seriously coding more using a terminal. I also received a higher certificate in Information Technology.</p>

                <h2>2016</h2>
                <p>This was my final year year of high school and I had already been coding in Delphi and my love of coding had grown. My teacher at the time advised me to enroll in a college and pursue degree in IT since a few of her previous students studied Computer Science and since my grades could not get me accepted in a public university so I opted for a private college and chose to study a BSc in IT.</p>
